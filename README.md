### code retreat

#### code retreat rules
* each session is 45 minutes long
* each pair switches with new members on every session change
* code must be deleted on every session change
* use test driven development

#### four rules of simple design
* tests pass
* expresses intent
* no duplication
* short

#### [conway's game of life rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conway%27s_game_of_life#rules)
* 1. any live cell with < 2 live neighbors dies of under population
* 2. any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on
* 3. any live cell with > 3 live neighbors dies of over population
* 4. any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors comes alive

#### constraints 

#### step 0
* no rules
* no constraints

#### step 1
* use test driven development (tdd)
* no constraints

#### step 2
* use tdd
* no primitives across method boundaries 
* input and output must be defined by us

#### step 3
* use tdd
* silent tdd
* no talking, no chatting

#### step 4
* use tdd
* code like it's 1969
* you can only run the tests and code twice for the whole session
